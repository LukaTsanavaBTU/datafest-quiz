# Quiz Prototype
A prototype for a project me and my friend - [Guram Jintcharadze](https://github.com/jinchara) made for a hackathon about medialiteracy. 
I won't go into the details of the idea itself, but this prototype is only a very simple interactive implementation of the concept, which we could show to the judges during the pitch.
We used only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.<br/>
